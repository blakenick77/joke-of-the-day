# joke-of-the-day
A simple web scraping script to grab jokes from a website and save them to a file. Written in Python 2.7.6

This file is a simple web scraping script used for educational purposes. A few things to note about this project:
1. if you are the owner of the website(s) being scraped by this script, and do not wish to have it used, plrease notify me and I will promptly remove it from the script.
2. If you are offended by any of the material that this script generates, please contact me. I tried to use great discretion in my choice of content, but may be unaware of some content on the site(s) used.
3. Please do not contact me to tell me how inefficient the code here is. It is for educational purposes only and the target audience is children. I went the route that I did to avoid using regular expressions and other more complex methodologies to make it easier to learn and understand.
